I developed the app, programmed the server side, did the infrastructure, and designed the site.\nI also have friends help me with data entry and test apps before they are released to the store.\nI manage to find time to make this app as a personal hobby, so if you would like to write a review for the store, I would appreciate it if you would be as kind as possible.",
